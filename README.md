## 🎓 Teaching Approach

### Progressive Learning

This bootcamp follows a **progressive learning approach**:

1. **Week 1-4:** Procedural Programming
   - Start with basic concepts (variables, loops, conditionals)
   - Introduce data structures (lists, dictionaries)
   - Build up to functions and modules
   - End with file I/O and error handling

2. **Week 5-8:** Object-Oriented and Functional Programming
   - Fresh start with OOP concepts
   - Build class hierarchies
   - Add functional programming patterns
   - Conclude with testing and best practices

### Evolving Projects

The bootcamp features **two evolving projects**:

**Project 1: Student Grade Manager** (Weeks 1-4)
- Demonstrates the evolution from simple scripts to modular applications
- Shows why we need lists (Week 1 uses only variables - intentionally painful!)
- Illustrates the power of functions and modules
- Ends with data persistence and error handling

**Project 2: Library Management System** (Weeks 5-8)
- Comprehensive OOP application
- Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism
- Integrates functional programming patterns
- Includes professional testing suite (55 unit tests)

### Concept Sequencing

**Strict concept sequencing** is maintained:
- Week 1 code uses **ONLY** Week 1 concepts (no lists!)
- Week 2 code can use Week 1-2 concepts (no functions!)
- Week 3 introduces functions and modules
- Week 4 adds error handling
- And so on...

This ensures students aren't confused by premature use of advanced concepts.
